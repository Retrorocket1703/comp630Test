During the first part of the assignment, we ran into a merge conflict 
when trying to resolve the hello.txt file. To solve this, we were able to 
manually edit the conflicting files, removing their errors. 
We also had an issue with authentication, which was resolved using the 
web interface for Github and adding Programmer B as a collaborator.
